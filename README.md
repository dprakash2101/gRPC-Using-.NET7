# gRPC with JSON Transcoding using .NET 7

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to implement gRPC communication with JSON transcoding using .NET 7. 
gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.
## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To work with this project, you need to have the following tools and software installed:

- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  
- Replace Connection srtring with your sql server Connection string

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dprakash2101/gRPC-Using-.NET7
Build and Run the Project
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repo
Build and run the project:
bash
Copy code
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
# Explore the Sample
### The sample project demonstrates a gRPC service with JSON transcoding. You can explore the following components:

1. Proto folder: Contains the gRPC service definition file in Protocol Buffers (protobuf) format.
2. Services folder: Contains the implementation of the gRPC service.
3. Program.cs: The entry point of the application.
4.Using the gRPC Service You can use the sample client or any gRPC client of your choice to interact with the service. The service exposes endpoints for gRPC communication over HTTP/2.



### Acknowledgments
1. This project is based on the official gRPC documentation.
2. JSON transcoding is implemented using grpc-dotnet.
